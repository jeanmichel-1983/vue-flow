        <strong>First off</strong>: A big thank you to the developers of
        <a href="https://webkid.io" target="_blank" class="text-green-500">Webkid</a>. Their amazing work made it possible for me
        to create this port to Vue 3 - without them there is no Vue Flow.

        Vue Flow is built on top of existing features and code taken from
        <a href="https://reactflow.dev" target="_blank" class="text-green-500">React Flow</a>. It replicates the basic features
        found in React Flow (zoom, pan, graph, additional components and more) and brings them to the Vue 3 experience, with all
        the fun reactivity and features like template slots etc. you know and love from Vue. If you're happy with Vue Flow,
        <br />
